# ViolenceDetection
Trained YOLOv8 models to detect guns and rifles and blur them within the video using CV2 library. Used parallel computing concepts to make both models work in sync. The code is designed to plug in any kind of model tasked to detect any kind of object within a video.

Due to lack of memory optimization, use only 2 models at a time.
